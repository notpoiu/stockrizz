# Stockrizz

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project that uses GPT-4o to analyse "rizz".

## Inspiration

Took inspiration from [this tiktok](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMrBfDyP9/) and thought why not turn it into a actual site (I was very bored ðŸ˜­)

## Setup

First, get your [openai api key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) and then create a new environement file (ex: `.env.local`).

Then put this in your environement file

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
```

Then install all the dependencies using the following commands:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
# or
bun install
```

## Testing

Finaly, to run the development server, use the following commands:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
